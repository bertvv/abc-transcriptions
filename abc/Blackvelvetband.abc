W:2. Well, I was out strolling one evening
W:Not meaning to go very far
W:When I met with a pretty young damsel
W:Who was selling her trade in the bar.
W:When I watched, she took from a customer
W:And slipped it right into my hand
W:Then the law it came and arrested me
W:Bad luck to the black velvet band.

W:3. Next morning before judge and jury
W:For a trial I had to appear
W:And the judge, he said, "Me young fellows...
W:The case against you is quite clear
W:And seven long years is your sentence
W:You're going to Van Dieman's Land
W:Far away from your friends and relations
W:To follow the black velvet band."
W:
W:4. So come all you jolly young fellows
W:I'd have you take warning by me
W:Whenever you're out on the liquor, me lads,
W:Beware of the pretty colleen.
W:She'll fill you with whiskey and porter
W:Until you're not able to stand
W:And the very next thing that you'll know, me lads,
W:You're landed in Van Dieman's Land.
